                        <h3>Multimeters</h3>
                        <p>The functions of each individual instrument can be combined into a single versatile instrument called multimeter. Multimeters are more commonly used in the field and are often known by other names such as volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM) and digital multimeter (DMM). A multimeter saves having to purchase numerous individual meters.</p>

                        <h3>Features of analogue and digital multimeters</h3>
                        <p>Electrical measuring instruments have traditionally been analogue. Analogue meters consist of a needle-type pointer that moves across a fixed scale. Modern instruments display digitally, using liquid-crystal or light-emitting diodes (LED). Digital instruments are not necessarily more accurate than analogue instruments, but they are often easier to read. Digital instruments will retain their accuracy regardless of how you position them, while analogue instruments are somewhat delicate and requires placement on a horizontal surface to retain their accuracy.</p>

                        <p>Digital multimeters can vary greatly in their operation and functions. Most multimeters can measure both alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc), whereas some voltmeters and ammeters can measure only one type of current. Always refer to the instrument's operating instruction booklet before using it to confirm its safe and proper use.</p>

                        <p>In order to measure voltage, you must connect a voltmeter across the two points in the circuit where the voltage appears (see Figure 7-1) or, in other words, in parallel with the part of the circuit under test.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>It is very important that the addition of the voltmeter into a circuit has very little effect on the conditions normally existing in the circuit. A voltmeter, therefore, must have a very high internal resistance, so that operating the instrument will draw very little current from that circuit. For maximum accuracy, a voltmeter's internal resistance should be many times higher than any resistance encountered in the circuit under test. Analogue voltmeters have internal resistances in the thousands of ohms, while digital instruments often have internal resistances in the millions of ohms.</p>

In other words, you must connect an ammeter in series with the circuit under test.

                        <p>It is very important to note that the insertion of the ammeter is designed to have very little effect on the normal current flowing in the circuit. The internal resistance of the ammeter is therefore very low, normally a fraction of an ohm. Due to the ammeter's low internal resistance, you must avoid connecting it across a load under test or the supply voltage itself. This would cause high current to flow through the ammeter, seriously damaging the instrument and possibly harming the operator. Some ammeters come with a fuse or circuit-breaker for protecting the instrument. Should this happen, however, you should never assume that this is adequate protection.</p>

                        <h2>Measuring resistance</h2>
                        
                        <p>Ohm's law tells us that, with a fixed value of voltage across a circuit, the value of current flowing depends upon the resistance of that circuit:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The higher the resistance, the lower the current flow.</li>
                            <li>The lower the resistance, the higher the current flow.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In other words, the value of the current flowing through a circuit is a guide to the resistance of that circuit. This is the principle of operation of the ohmmeter.</p>

                        <p>The ohmmeter is an instrument similar to an ammeter connected in series with a rheostat (variable resistor) and a battery (see Figure 7-3). A case with a scale, terminals, and the variable resistor's control-knob visible contains these components. The ohmmeter works in the following manner:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The test-leads are connected to the instrument's terminals and are first short-circuited together.</li>
                            <li>Adjustment of rheostat occurs until the instrument registers full-scale deflection—this corresponds to zero ohms.</li>
                            <li>Now, the test-leads are connected to the circuit or component under test.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The resulting current through the ohmmeter will be lower than it was before, because of the added resistance, and the instrument's pointer will register somewhat less than full-scale deflection. Rather than calibrating the scale in amperes, which is what the instrument is really reading, the manufacturer has calibrated it directly in ohms.</p>

                        <h3>Analogue ohmmeter scale</h3>
                        <p>Unlike the voltmeter and the ammeter, the most noticeable thing about an analogue ohmmeter's scale is that you read it from right to left. Furthermore, it is non-linear. This means that the graduations that represent the higher values of resistance (to the left side of the scale) are very close together, while those representing lower values (to the right side of the scale) have wider spacings.</p>

                        <p>Using the built-in rheostat to adjust for full-scale deflection is what you call zero ohms adjustment. You must perform it before using the ohmmeter to measure resistance. This compensates for any variation in the voltage of the instrument's battery. If you cannot achieve zero ohms adjustment, it means the battery is too weak and needs replacement.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Always be aware of inadvertently measuring the resistance of other components that are connected in parallel with the component under test. You may have to physically remove the component from the circuit before performing the test.</li>
                                    <li>Technicians/fitters very often use ohmmeters to check for continuity—to confirm, for example, that a circuit, or component, is not open-circuited. When checking continuity, the actual resistance of the circuit or component is unimportant—a simple deflection of the pointer confirms continuity.</li>
                                    <li>Always switch an ohmmeter off when measurements are completed. If you fail to do this, and the test-leads are accidentally left shorted together, then the instrument's battery will very quickly discharge.</li>

                                    <li>Just like the ammeter, an ohmmeter must never be connected across a live load or the supply voltage itself. This would cause high current to flow through the ammeter, seriously damaging the instrument and possibly harming the operator!</li>

                        <h2>Variable range instruments</h2>
                        <p>In order to extend their versatility, most electrical measuring instruments have several ranges. For example, you may adjust a voltmeter to read: 0 to 5 V, 0 to 10 V, 0 to 25 V, and 0 to 100 V.</p>

                        <h3>Scale selection</h3>
                        <p>An analogue voltmeter may have four separate scales or only one scale (say, 0 to 5 V), in which case you must multiply its reading by factors of x2, x5, or x20, according to the selected range. The method for selecting the range on such an instrument varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, with the most common being a rotary knob that aligns with ranges engraved onto the case. Modern digital instruments often select the appropriate range automatically.</p>

                        <h3>Range selection</h3>
                        <p>If you are unsure of the value of voltage or current that you are about to measure, always start with the highest range and work down until you achieve the greatest readable deflection of the pointer. Despite this, you should always estimate the likely value of voltage or current before performing the test, just in case it is beyond even the highest range of the instrument.</p>

                        <p>For maximum accuracy with analogue instruments, always select the range that gives the greatest readable deflection because all instruments are calibrated to give maximum accuracy at full-scale deflection.</p>

                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <h4>💡 Accuracy Tip</h4>
                            <p>For example, suppose a 100 V voltmeter is manufactured to an accuracy of ±5%. This accuracy applies to the instrument's full-scale deflection. When it indicates 100 V, the actual voltage could be anywhere between 95 V and 105 V. However, when the same instrument indicates only 10 V, it is still accurate to ±5 V, so the actual voltage could range from 5 V to 15 V!</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>In the case of an ohmmeter, you must adjust the instrument for zero ohms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>each time its range is changed; and</li>
                            <li>before you use it to take a measurement.</li>

                        <h4>Measuring Resistance and Testing for Continuity</h4>
                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>⚠️ Warning</h4>
                            <p>To avoid electric shock, injury, or damage to the meter, disconnect circuit power and discharge all high-voltage capacitors before testing resistance, continuity, diodes, or capacitance.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Note: The continuity function works best as a fast, convenient method to check for opens and shorts. For maximum accuracy in making resistance measurements, use the meter's resistance (Ω) function.</p>

                        <h4>Measuring AC and DC Voltage</h4>
                        <p>With the function switch in the AUTO-V position, the meter automatically selects a dc or ac voltage measurement based on the input applied between the V or + and COM jacks. This function also sets the meter's input impedance to approximately 3kΩ to reduce the possibility of false readings due to ghost voltages.</p>

                                <li>Never place the probes in parallel with a circuit or component when the leads are plugged into the A (amps) terminals.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Turn circuit power off, break the circuit, insert the meter in series with the circuit, and then turn circuit power on.</p>

            "A voltmeter must be connected in parallel with the circuit or component being tested to measure the voltage drop across it without significantly affecting circuit operation.",
            "An ammeter must be connected in series with the circuit, meaning the circuit must be broken and the ammeter inserted so all current flows through it.",
