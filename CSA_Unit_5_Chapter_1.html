                        <h2>Electrical Safety Hazards</h2>
                        
                        <p>Two common electrical hazards are static electricity and electric shock.</p>

                        <h3>Static Electricity</h3>
                        <p>Static electricity is energy in the form of a stationary electric charge such as that stored in thunderclouds or produced by friction. A static charge is the accumulated electric charge that is present on an object.</p>

                        <p>The main danger from static electricity is arcing. Arcing is a lightning-like discharge of electricity across an insulating medium or air space. The arc can ignite flammable gases or materials that it comes in contact with. A good example of this phenomenon is the ignition of the fuel mixture by a spark plug in an automobile engine.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>⚡ Static Electricity Danger</h4>
                            <p>In gas environments, static electricity can create sparks that may ignite flammable gases. Always ensure proper grounding and follow static discharge prevention procedures.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Electric Shock</h3>
                        <p>When working with electrical equipment, you must be constantly aware of the hazard of electric shock. You must know what factors increase the danger of shock, how to avoid shock, and what to do when dealing with a shock victim.</p>

                        <h4>Factors affecting electric shock</h4>
                        <p>When a person receives a shock, the electric current passes through the person, (usually to the earth or ground). The severity of the shock depends upon how much current passes through the body. The factors that affect the severity of a shock are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>amount and path of current;</li>
                            <li>type of voltage (ac or dc);</li>
                            <li>value of voltage;</li>
                            <li>length of time the body is energized;</li>
                            <li>condition of the skin; and</li>
                            <li>area of contact.</li>

                        <h3>Voltage</h3>
                        <p>In practice, operating a flashlight is usually perfectly safe. This is because the flashlight cell has a very low voltage that cannot overcome the resistance of human skin and current flow is limited.</p>

                        <p>The danger of shock increases as voltage increases, but low voltages are not necessarily safe. Contact with 120 volts ac, the common household voltage, has led to more deaths than with any other voltage. Note that AC voltages above 750 volts are high voltage.</p>

                        <p>DC voltages can be very dangerous. Industrial voltages as small as 42 volts dc can be lethal.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>⚠️ Voltage Safety Facts</h4>
                            <p>Although 75 volts can be just as lethal as 1000 volts, victims of high-voltage shock usually respond better to resuscitation. Low-voltage shock victims do not respond well to artificial respiration because it causes uncoordinated twitching of the heart walls.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Resistance of the Human Body</h3>
                        <p>The electrical resistance of the human body varies because of moisture, salt, and abrasions on the skin. Resistance of the skin varies from 100 ohms to over 500,000 ohms. The applied voltage, the duration of applied voltage, and the points of contact also affect skin resistance.</p>

                        <h4>Moisture and Salt</h4>
                        <p>When skin is wet or salty, its resistance drops to several hundred from several thousand ohms. Therefore, weather can affect the hazard of shock. Wet, humid, or hot weather causes perspiration, thus reducing resistance. Cold, dry weather may increase skin resistance. Vigorous exercise can also increase perspiration and reduce resistance.</p>

                        <h4>Contact Points</h4>
                        <p>The body has different resistance at different contact points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Between the ears: only 100 ohms</li>
                            <li>From hand to foot: nearly 500 ohms</li>

                        <h2>Rescuing Shock Victims</h2>
                        
                        <p>You must always take general precautions in the case of electrical shock.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>🚨 Emergency Response Priority</h4>
                            <p><strong>ACT FAST!</strong> The resistance of the victim decreases with time, and the victim can die in just a few seconds.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Key Safety Rules</h3>
                        <p><strong>Never touch a victim who is still connected to the electric power.</strong> If you do, you will also experience shock.</p>

                        <p>First, try to disconnect the electricity. If you cannot quickly find the switch or plug, try to pull the victim and live conductor(s) apart. Use a dry wooden pole or some other dry insulating material (such as wood, glass, paper, cloth, etc.). <strong>Do not use your hands or a conducting material.</strong></p>

                        <p>If the victim is unconscious and has stopped breathing, start artificial respiration at once. <strong>DO NOT STOP</strong> until a medical authority advises you to stop.</p>

                        <h3>Five-Step Rescue Procedure</h3>
                        <p>In the absence of other instructions, follow these five simple steps to rescue a shock victim:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Protect yourself</strong> - do not touch the energized victim.</li>
                            <li><strong>Free the victim</strong> from electrical contact.</li>
                            <li><strong>Apply cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</strong> or artificial respiration, as necessary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Have someone call</strong> a doctor, nurse, fire department, rescue unit, or police unit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continue resuscitation attempts</strong> until a medical authority advises you to stop.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Grounding</h2>
                        
                        <p>Proper grounding of tools, equipment, and sources of static discharge is essential for reducing the risk of electrical hazards.</p>

                        <p>You shall effectively ground portable tools and equipment that require grounding and are not permanently connected to the wiring system through the use of approved three-wire cords and three-prong polarized plugs inserted in grounded polarized receptacles.</p>

                        <p>You must install ground straps where necessary to prevent static discharge.</p>

                        <h3>Double-Insulated Tools</h3>
                        <p>Many modern portable tools may not have a three-pronged plug but instead are double-insulated and have a two-pronged plug. A tool that is double-insulated provides equivalent shock hazard protection as a tool with a three-pronged grounded plug.</p>

                        <div class="electrical-symbol">
                            <p>Double Insulated Symbol: <span class="double-insulated-symbol"></span></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>If you use a power tool with a two-pronged plug, ensure that the tool is double-insulated. To determine if the tool is double-insulated, the tool should have certification (e.g., by CSA) and marking with either the words "DOUBLE INSULATED" or the symbol shown above.</p>

                        <p>As a gas technician/fitter, you may often be in an area where employees carry out maintenance procedures on powered machinery. During these times, detailed lock-out procedures are essential to prevent unexpected operation and energizing of the machinery you are working on.</p>

                        <p>Lock-out must involve more than merely disconnecting the power source. Electrically de-energized machinery that has its hydraulic systems still pressurized has already killed workers. Thus, you must assess the machine thoroughly, and make all energy sources, including electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or gravitational, inoperative. This is what you often call <strong>zero mechanical state</strong>.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>⚠️ Zero Mechanical State</h4>
                            <p>Zero mechanical state is when you make ALL energy sources, including electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or gravitational, inoperative. This is critical for worker safety.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Personal Lock-out Requirements</h3>
                        <p>As a technician/fitter, you should have your own lock and key (combination locks are not allowed), and use only these locks to lock out energy sources. Inform the machine operator of maintenance plans and tag the lock to identify the individual who has locked out the machinery.</p>

                        <p><strong>The only person permitted to remove the lock is the individual who placed the lock on the machinery.</strong></p>

                        <p>Note that these procedures apply not only to stationary industrial equipment but also to mobile equipment, including passenger cars, truck equipment, and heavy construction equipment.</p>
