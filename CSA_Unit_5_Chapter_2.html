                        <p>Everything that has mass or occupies space is what you call matter. The smallest particle of matter that can take part in a chemical reaction is an atom. Atoms are the submicroscopic building blocks of matter. They combine to form larger particles called molecules. Atoms and molecules are much too small to be seen or weighed directly.</p>

                        <p>Atoms and molecules form various elements and compounds. An element is a substance made up of only one kind of atom. A compound contains more than one type of atom, chemically combined. Water is an example of a compound. Each water molecule is made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. To understand electricity, you must know something about the structure of atoms.</p>

                            <li>electrons.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Although scientists have found further subdivisions of these particles, it is only necessary for our understanding of electricity to focus on protons and electrons.</p>

                        <h2>The number of subatomic particles in an atom</h2>
                        
                        <p>The number of electrons, protons, and neutrons in the atoms of an element determines how that element behaves.</p>

                        <p>Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons in their nuclei. This number is the atomic number that identifies that element. For example, the nucleus of a carbon atom always contains 6 protons, and you say that the atomic number of carbon is 6. The atomic number of helium is 2, and the atomic number of copper is 29.</p>

                        <h3>Sizes of subatomic particles</h3>
                        <p>Subatomic particles are extremely small. Electrons are about three times as large as protons, but they are 1840 times lighter. They are easy to move. Neutrons have about the same mass as protons.</p>

                        <h3>Electrical charges of subatomic particles</h3>
                        <p>The electron carries the basic unit of electrical charge. For historical reasons, an electron's charge is considered to be a negative (-) charge. Because it is free to move, an electron actively participates in the transfer of electrical energy.</p>

                        <p>The proton carries a positive (+) charge, opposite to that of an electron. It has the same size of charge as the electron's negative one. Protons are not directly active in the flow of electrical energy, but they do influence the flow of electrons.</p>

                        <p>The nucleus of an atom has an overall positive electrical charge due to the protons. The negatively charged electrons revolve around the positive nucleus.</p>

                        <h2>Electrostatic charges and fields</h2>
                        
                        <p>Electrostatic charges and fields are also known as static electricity. Static electricity is energy in the form of a stationary electric charge such as that stored in thunderclouds or produced by friction. For example, when you rub together certain pairs of materials (such as fur and a rubber rod), an electrostatic charge is produced. The friction produces heat energy that releases electrons from the atoms on the surface of one of the materials.</p>

                        <h3>Electrical charges</h3>
                        <p>An object may possess a positive electrical charge, a negative electrical charge, or it may be electrically neutral. The type of charge that an object has depends on the number of electrons and protons it has.</p>

                        <h3>Law of electrical charges</h3>
                        <p>A fundamental law governs the way charged particles behave:</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <h4>Fundamental Law of Electrical Charges</h4>
                            <p><strong>Like charges repel and unlike charges attract.</strong></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Negatively charged particles repel other negatively charged particles. They tend to move away from each other. Similarly, positively charged particles repel each other. However, negatively charged particles attract positively charged particles. They tend to move toward each other.</p>

                        <p>Because of this law:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Protons (+) and electrons (-) attract each other.</li>
                            <li>Protons repel other protons.</li>
                            <li>Electrons repel other electrons.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Electrostatic forces and fields</h3>
                        <p>The electrical charges on protons and electrons are electrostatic charges. An electrostatic charge has an electrostatic field associated with it and, within this field, electrostatic forces occur. These forces are the forces of attraction and repulsion between charged particles.</p>

                        <p>The strength of the forces of attraction and repulsion depends on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the amount of charge on each object; and</li>
                            <li>the square of the distance between the objects.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The greater the electric charges on the objects, the greater the electrostatic force. Also, the closer the charged objects are to each other, the greater the electrostatic force.</p>

                        <h2>Production and use of electricity</h2>
                        
                        <p>During removal of electrons from their atoms (so that they are free to move), the moving electrons may transfer electrical energy. The term electric current usually refers to this.</p>

                        <h3>Production of electricity</h3>
                        <p>The following are examples of ways to apply enough force to remove the electrons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>heat—thermoelectricity;</li>
                            <li>magnetism—electromagnetism;</li>
                            <li>chemicals—electrochemistry;</li>
                            <li>pressure—piezoelectricity; and</li>
                            <li>light—photoelectricity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Thermoelectricity</h4>
                        <p>The application of heat to two different metals joined together leads to the transfer of electrons across the junction, resulting in one side becoming positive with respect to the other. This is the action of a thermocouple. Several thermocouples, when joined, form a thermopile.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thermocouples often function as thermometers to detect and measure temperature. The current that a thermocouple produces is enough to hold in a small electromagnet within a gas valve, indicating the presence or absence of a pilot flame.</p>

                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <h4>🔥 Gas Industry Application</h4>
                            <p>Thermocouples are widely used in gas appliances as safety devices. They generate a small electrical current when heated by a pilot flame, which keeps a safety valve open. If the pilot goes out, the thermocouple cools, stops generating current, and the safety valve closes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Electromagnetism</h4>
                        <p>Magnetic force fields surround magnets, which have magnetic poles that attract or repel each other. When a conductor passes a magnetic field, the forces of the magnetic field act on the electrons in the conductor, causing them to move through the conductor. The same thing happens if you hold steady the conductor in a moving magnetic field. An electric generator produces electricity by electromagnetism.</p>

                        <h4>Electrochemistry</h4>
                        <p>A flashlight battery is a common example of the electrochemical production of electricity. A battery is a group of voltaic cells. A voltaic cell is a product of immersing two different metal electrodes in a chemical solution called electrolyte. This creates a difference of potential between the two electrodes.</p>

                        <p>Chemical action that results in the transfer of electrons from one electrode to the other through the electrolyte causes the difference in potential. The electrode that gives up electrons becomes positively charged and the other electrode, which gains electrons, becomes negatively charged.</p>

                        <h4>Piezoelectricity</h4>
                        <p>Force from the application of pressure to certain crystal materials drives the free electrons out of orbit. Positive and negative charges build up on opposite sides of the material. You use this principle in such things as spark igniters for gas barbecues.</p>

                        <h4>Photoelectricity</h4>
                        <p>When light strikes certain materials (such as potassium and sodium), the energy from the light causes the atoms to release electrons. This is the photoelectric effect.</p>

                        <h2>Electric current</h2>
                        
                        <p>In static electricity, electric charges are at rest. Static electricity normally does not perform useful work. To use electrical energy to do work, set the electrons in directed motion.</p>

                        <p>When you make electrons to move in the same direction, they produce an electric current. The flow of electric current carries energy that can perform work. The more electrons that move in the same direction, the greater the flow of current and the greater the amount of available energy.</p>

                        <h3>Conducting and insulating materials</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Conductors</h4>
                        <p>Materials that conduct electricity well and have low electrical resistance are conductors. Most metals are good conductors, but some are better than others. Silver is the best pure metal conductor, with copper second. Because of its relatively low cost, copper is most commonly used for wires. Technicians use aluminum, also a good conductor, for high-voltage transmission lines because it is much lighter and cheaper than copper.</p>

                        <p>Conductors heat up when current is flowing through them. This is a good thing in the case of conductors that work as heating elements, but not a good thing in the case of using conductors in electrical transmission.</p>

                        <h4>Insulators</h4>
                        <p>Many materials do not conduct electricity well. They are insulators. Plastic, glass, and porcelain are poor conductors of electricity and are extensively used as electrical insulators. Household wiring consists of pure copper conductors with a plastic layer of insulation. This insulation provides protection from electric shock and prevents short-circuiting of the system.</p>

                        <p>Lower voltages require less insulation, so relatively thin plastic can be used. For higher voltages, thicker plastic insulation must be used. For very high voltages, plastic is not an adequate insulator. At very high voltages, porcelain, glass, air, or oil function as insulators.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>⚡ High Voltage Safety</h4>
                            <p>High-voltage electricity can arc or jump across an air gap from one point to another if the voltage between the two points is strong enough. For this reason, personnel must remain well clear of high-voltage equipment. Lightning is an example of electricity passing through air, requiring billions of volts.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Electron movement in a conductor</h3>
                        <p>In the atoms of a good electrical conductor (such as copper wire), free electrons are in constant but random motion. The nuclei stay in a relatively distinct pattern, but the free electrons change orbits at random and the atoms share the free electrons. Metallic bonding binds the atoms together.</p>

                        <h3>Current flow</h3>
                        <p>To produce a flow of electricity or current in a conductor, make the electrons move in a direction along the conductor by placing opposite (positive and negative) charges on the ends of the conductor. The free negative electrons move toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge.</p>

                        <p>Individual electrons do not move very far in the conductor, but the effect of electric current moves down the conductor at the speed of light (297,600 km per second). As each electron leaves its own orbit and enters another, it repels another electron out of orbit, and so on. The rapidly moving current is the impulse of these changes moving along the length of the conductor. This is similar to the impulse of falling dominoes moving the length of the row, while each domino makes only a slight movement.</p>

                        <h3>Direct current and alternating current</h3>
                        <p>When current flows in a constant direction, it is a direct current (dc). Alternating current (ac), on the other hand, regularly reverses direction and occurs during reversal of the polarity of each end of the conductor, which is always the case with house current.</p>
