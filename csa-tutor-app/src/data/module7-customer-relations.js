  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "How do I explain technical problems to customers who don't understand gas systems?",
      answer: "Use simple analogies and avoid technical jargon. For example, compare gas pressure to water pressure, or explain a heat exchanger like a radiator in a car. Show diagrams when helpful, and always check if they understand before moving on."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do when a customer questions my work or pricing?",
      answer: "Listen to their concerns without getting defensive. Explain your work step-by-step, show them relevant code requirements, and provide documentation. If needed, offer to have a supervisor review the work. Transparency builds trust."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I handle customers who want me to ignore safety codes?",
      answer: "Never compromise on safety. Explain that codes exist to protect them and their family, and that you could lose your license for non-compliant work. Offer alternatives that meet both their needs and code requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best way to protect customer property during work?",
      answer: "Use drop cloths, shoe covers, and protective coverings. Move furniture and belongings carefully. Clean up as you work, not just at the end. Take photos before starting work in case of damage claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How should I handle emergency service calls?",
      answer: "Stay calm and professional even under pressure. Explain the urgency and safety concerns clearly. Get customer permission before shutting off gas or making emergency repairs. Document everything thoroughly."
