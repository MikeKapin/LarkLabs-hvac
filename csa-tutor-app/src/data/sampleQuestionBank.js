      correct_answer: "DN20 (3/4 inch)",
      explanation: "Using the longest length method: 1) Total equivalent length = 30m + fittings allowance (~5m) = 35m equivalent length. 2) From CSA B149.1 sizing tables for steel pipe with 150 MJ/h load and 35m equivalent length, DN20 (3/4 inch) pipe provides adequate capacity while maintaining pressure drop within 0.5 kPa limit.

        ]
      },
      correct_answer: 0,
      explanation: "CSA B149.1 defines low-pressure systems as operating at pressures not exceeding 1.75 kPa (7 inches water column). This pressure classification determines the materials, installation methods, and safety requirements that apply to the gas system. Systems operating above this pressure require different design considerations and materials.",
