Both are essential for gas technicians working with different fuel types."},{question:"Who has authority to inspect gas installations?",answer:"Provincial regulatory authorities (like TSSA in Ontario, TSBC in BC) have primary jurisdiction. Authorized inspectors can enter properties, examine installations, issue stop work orders, and ensure code compliance."},{question:"What happens if I work without proper licensing?",answer:"Working without proper licensing can result in stop work orders, fines, legal penalties, liability issues, and potential criminal charges if public safety is compromised. Always ensure current licensing and permits."},{question:"Can local codes be more restrictive than provincial codes?",answer:"Yes, local codes and bylaws can be more restrictive than provincial or national codes, but they cannot be less restrictive. Always check local requirements and apply the most restrictive standard."},{question:"How often do I need to renew my gas technician license?",answer:"License renewal periods vary by province but typically range from 1-5 years. Renewal usually requires continuing education, fees, and demonstration of ongoing competency. Check with your provincial authority for specific requirements."}],codeReferences:[{code:"CSA B149.1",section:"6.2",topic:"Pipe Sizing",requirement:"Piping systems shall be sized to deliver required gas flow at minimum allowable pressure"},{code:"CSA B149.1",section:"7.4",topic:"Leak Testing",requirement:"All piping systems must be pressure tested and leak tested before being placed in service"},{code:"CSA B149.2",section:"5.3",topic:"Propane Storage",requirement:"Propane containers must be stored with proper clearances and protection from damage"}],regulatoryBodies:{"British Columbia":"Technical Safety BC (TSBC)",Alberta:"Alberta Boilers Safety Association (ABSA)",Ontario:"Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA)",Quebec:"Régie du bâtiment du Québec (RBQ)",Maritime:"Various provincial authorities"},licenseClasses:[{class:"G3",description:"Basic gas technician - residential appliances and simple piping",scope:"Single family residential, basic appliances under 400,000 BTU/hr"},{class:"G2",description:"Intermediate gas technician - commercial and complex residential",scope:"Multi-unit residential, commercial applications, complex systems"},{class:"G1",description:"Advanced gas technician - all gas installations",scope:"Industrial, high-pressure systems, unlimited applications"}],keywords:["CSA B149.1","CSA B149.2","codes","regulations","licensing","permits","TSSA","TSBC","inspection","compliance","violations","enforcement","natural gas code","propane code","installation standards","safety requirements","professional responsibility","legal framework","jurisdiction","authority"]};export{e as module4CodesData};
