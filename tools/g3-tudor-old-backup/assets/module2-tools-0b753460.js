PTFE tape can be used but must be applied correctly (clockwise) and not extend into the pipe bore. Never use liquid sealants that are not gas-rated."},{question:"How often should gas detection equipment be calibrated?",answer:"Gas detectors should receive a bump test daily before use and full calibration monthly or per manufacturer specifications. Always use certified calibration gas and maintain calibration records."},{question:"What's the difference between NPT and BSP threads?",answer:"NPT (National Pipe Thread) is a tapered thread standard common in North America, while BSP (British Standard Pipe) can be parallel or tapered. They are not interchangeable and mixing them will result in leaks."},{question:"When should I use a torque wrench on gas connections?",answer:"Use a torque wrench when manufacturer specifications require it, particularly on critical connections, flanged joints, and when working with soft materials like brass fittings that can be easily damaged by over-tightening."},{question:"Can I use regular tools in potentially explosive atmospheres?",answer:"No, in potentially explosive atmospheres you must use intrinsically safe or explosion-proof tools. Regular tools can create sparks that could ignite gas vapors. Always assess the environment before selecting tools."}],practicalScenarios:[{title:"Pipe Threading Operation",scenario:"Threading 1-inch steel pipe for gas service",requiredTools:["Pipe threading machine or manual dies","Cutting oil or threading compound","Pipe cutter or hack saw","Deburring tool","Thread gauge for verification"],procedure:["Cut pipe to required length","Deburr inside and outside edges","Apply cutting oil to threading dies","Thread pipe to proper depth","Check thread quality with gauge","Clean threads before assembly"],safetyNotes:"Ensure adequate ventilation when using cutting oils and wear safety glasses"}],toolSpecifications:[{tool:"Pipe Wrench",sizes:'10", 14", 18", 24", 36"',application:"Gripping and turning threaded pipe and fittings",maintenance:"Keep jaws clean and properly adjusted"},{tool:"Combustible Gas Detector",range:"0-100% LEL (Lower Explosive Limit)",accuracy:"Â±5% of reading",calibration:"Monthly with certified gas mixture"}],keywords:["tools","fasteners","NPT threads","pipe wrench","gas detector","calibration","thread sealant","PTFE tape","torque","pressure test","leak detection","measurement","testing equipment","maintenance","tool safety","threading","joining methods","sealants"]};export{e as module2ToolsData};
