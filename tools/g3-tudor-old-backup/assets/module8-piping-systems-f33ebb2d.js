Pipe is sized by nominal diameter, tubing by outside diameter. Both have specific applications and installation requirements."},{question:"How do I calculate equivalent pipe length for fittings?",answer:"Each fitting adds resistance equivalent to a certain length of straight pipe. For example, a 90° elbow might equal 3 feet of straight pipe. Add these equivalent lengths to your actual pipe length for sizing calculations."},{question:"What thread sealant should I use on gas connections?",answer:"Use only approved pipe thread sealants designed for gas service. Apply to male threads only, don't over-apply, and ensure it doesn't extend into the pipe bore where it could contaminate the gas system."},{question:"Can I use CSST (corrugated stainless steel tubing) everywhere?",answer:"CSST has specific installation requirements: it needs bonding for electrical safety, protection from damage, proper fittings, and cannot be used in certain locations like concealed spaces in some jurisdictions. Always check local codes."},{question:"What's the minimum pipe size allowed for gas systems?",answer:'CSA B149.1 typically requires minimum 1/2" pipe for most installations, but individual appliances may have smaller connection sizes. The system must be sized to deliver adequate gas flow at proper pressure to all appliances.'}],sizingExamples:[{title:"Residential Gas Line Sizing",scenario:"Size main line for house with furnace (80,000 BTU) and water heater (40,000 BTU)",calculation:["Total load: 80,000 + 40,000 = 120,000 BTU/hr","Convert to ft³/hr: 120,000 ÷ 1000 = 120 ft³/hr","Measure longest run including equivalent fittings","Use sizing table for calculated flow and length","Select pipe size that meets requirements"],result:'Typically requires 3/4" to 1" main line depending on length'}],materialComparison:[{material:"Black Iron Pipe",advantages:["Strong and durable","Good for high pressure","Threaded connections"],disadvantages:["Heavy","Rust potential","Labor intensive"],applications:["Indoor installations","High pressure systems"]},{material:"Copper Tubing",advantages:["Corrosion resistant","Easy to bend","Good heat transfer"],disadvantages:["More expensive","Soft metal","Special fittings"],applications:["Indoor installations","Appliance connections"]},{material:"CSST",advantages:["Flexible","Quick installation","Earthquake resistant"],disadvantages:["Requires bonding","Lightning protection","Special tools"],applications:["New construction","Renovation projects"]}],installationTips:["Always cut pipe square and remove burrs","Use proper pipe thread compound on male threads only","Support pipe properly to prevent sagging","Protect underground piping from corrosion","Test all joints before covering or concealing","Label all shut-off valves clearly","Maintain proper clearances from electrical systems","Document system layout for future reference"],safetyReminders:["Never use gas piping as electrical ground","Protect piping from physical damage","Ensure proper bonding of CSST systems","Use only approved materials and methods","Test system thoroughly before gas introduction","Follow proper purging procedures","Maintain adequate clearances from heat sources"],keywords:["piping","tubing","black iron","copper","CSST","pipe sizing","pressure drop","equivalent length","threading","fittings","joints","installation","testing","leak detection","materials","NPT threads","compression fittings","flare connections","pipe supports"]};export{e as module8PipingSystemsData};
