# Canadian Gas Piping Calculator - Test Results

## Test Scenarios Performed

### Test 1: Basic Natural Gas Calculation
**Inputs:**
- Appliance: Water Heater, 40,000 Btu/h
- LMR: 50 feet
- Pipe Type: Schedule 40 Black Iron
- Pressure: 0.5 in w.c.
- Gas Type: Natural Gas

**Expected Result:**
- Should recommend appropriate pipe size (likely 3/4" or 1")
- Should show capacity, utilization, and available capacity
- Should use standard natural gas density (0.6)

### Test 2: Propane Gas Calculation
**Inputs:**
- Appliance: Furnace, 80,000 Btu/h
- LMR: 75 feet
- Pipe Type: Type K Copper
- Pressure: 2 psig
- Gas Type: Propane

**Expected Result:**
- Should recommend larger pipe size than natural gas
- Should use Annex B propane tables
- Should show propane density (1.5)

### Test 3: Multiple Appliances with Validation
**Inputs:**
- Add multiple appliances with various Btu/h ratings
- Test duplicate names (should show error)
- Test negative values (should show error)
- Test empty fields (should show error)

**Expected Result:**
- Should validate all inputs
- Should prevent calculation with errors
- Should sum total Btu/h correctly

### Test 4: Custom Gas Density
**Inputs:**
- Appliance: Combined load, 120,000 Btu/h  
- LMR: 100 feet
- Custom Gas Density: 0.8
- Pipe Type: Schedule 40 Black Iron
- Pressure: 2 psig

**Expected Result:**
- Should apply Table A.15 density multiplier
- Should show base capacity and adjusted capacity
- Should indicate custom density was used

### Test 5: Edge Cases
**Inputs:**
- Very high Btu/h load (500,000+)
- Very long LMR (300+ feet)
- Invalid density values (outside 0.35-2.10)

**Expected Result:**
- Should handle large loads appropriately
- Should warn about long runs
- Should validate density range
