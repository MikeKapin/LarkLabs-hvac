# Gas Pipe Calculator Icon Replacement Instructions

## Overview
The Canadian Gas Pipe Sizing Calculator has been set up as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with placeholder icons. You need to replace these with your custom gas pipe calculator icon (the blue image with the Canadian maple leaf and calculator).

## Files to Replace

Replace these placeholder icon files in the `apps/calculators/icons/` directory:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels) - Used for Android home screen
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels) - Used for splash screen and Android install prompt  
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180 pixels) - Used for iOS home screen

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background recommended
- **Design**: Should be your gas pipe calculator icon (blue background, maple leaf, calculator)
