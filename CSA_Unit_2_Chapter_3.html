                        <p>Electric power tools are either battery-powered (cordless) or plugged into an electrical receptacle (corded).</p>
                        
                        <p>Some tools derive power from other sources of energy, such as gasoline engines and pneumatic (air) pressure.</p>
                        
                        <p>Whatever the source of energy used to run the tool, the safety precautions are basically the same. The gas technician/fitter must follow the manufacturer's safety requirements for each tool, the employer's policy, and the supervisor's instructions.</p>

                        <h3>Cordless tools</h3>
                        <p>Most tools that gas technicians/fitters use are available in a cordless option for most applications. Cordless tools have many advantages and some disadvantages. The most obvious advantage is that the lack of an electrical cord frees up the tool for wider use and for applications where electric tools with a higher voltage are not suitable and where a risk of electrical shock exists. One disadvantage of a cordless tool is the need to charge the battery. You need to treat the battery chargers like any other 115- or 230-volt device, respecting all safety requirements and electrical codes.</p>

                        <p>The batteries for cordless tools have many different designs, applications, and special safety considerations. Follow all the manufacturer's instructions for charging, handling, and disposing of batteries for cordless tools.</p>

                        <p>The most common cordless tool is the cordless drill shown in Figure 3-1.</p>

                        <p>The gas technician/fitter uses many types of electric drills. Some drills work on 110 V or 115 V alternating current (ac) and some are powered by rechargeable batteries that typically run on 18-20 V direct current (dc). The three most common types of portable electric power drills used in the piping trades are the 1/2 in (12 mm) portable drill, the 3/8 in (9 mm) portable drill, and the hammer drill. The sizes refer to the maximum size of drill shank that can fit into the chuck.</p>

                        <h2>Electric saws</h2>
                        
                        <p>Gas technicians/fitters often use electric saws of several different types. They allow for efficient, high-quality work. Removal of the burr, which is the sharp edge left by a saw, is recommended. Careful selection of saw type and blade can reduce burr to acceptable levels.</p>

                        <h3>Cutting rates</h3>
                        <p>A feed that is too light overheats the wheel. Heavy feeding may cause the wheel to wear quickly or to break. Feed rates depend on the type of material to be cut, the type of wheel being used, the operating speed of the machine, and the condition of the abrasive sawing machine.</p>

                        <p>For most cutting operations, gas technicians/fitters use anti-welding lubricants. This reduces friction between the cutting blade and the cut material as well as the chances of burning or breaking the blade, giving a smoother, even cut.</p>

                        <h3>Heavy-duty circular saws</h3>
                        <p>Gas technicians/fitters use this most familiar type of circular saw (Figure 3-7) for making cuts along a marked line. They may help cut most shapes of plastic and non-ferrous metal stock such as pipe, tubing, and bars.</p>

                        <div class="image-card">
                            <div class="image-placeholder">⚙️</div>
                            <div class="image-caption">Heavy-Duty Circular Saw</div>
                            <div class="image-description">For cutting plastic and non-ferrous metals</div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Chop saws</h3>
                        <p>The chop saw (Figure 3-8) is a large cutting tool often used to cut steel. You can place it flat on the floor, on a bench, or on a sawhorse. Individual and gang cutting tasks are both possible with a chop saw. Pay special attention to the personal protective equipment required for safe use of the different saw blades, and always wear a full face shield approved for the use.</p>

                        <h3>Reciprocating saws (saber saw)</h3>
                        <p>Gas technicians/fitters widely use reciprocating saws (Figure 3-9), which are often called power hacksaws. They cut long pieces of pipe, wood, and laminates into lengths suitable for machining as well as pipe chases and oddly shaped holes in wood frame construction. They cut nearly any shape if you use the correct blade. Many types of reciprocating saws have more than one speed.</p>

                        <h3>Saber saw blades</h3>
                        <p>Blades for these saws are made from carbide steel and high-speed alloy steel. They are color coded according to their use. For example, a blade for cutting stainless steel may be coded bright blue, while a general-purpose blade for cutting wood that may contain nails may be black. Be sure to check that you have the correct blade for the job. The blades come in various lengths, pitches (number of teeth per inch), tooth shapes, and tooth patterns (sets).</p>

                        <h2>Power grinders</h2>
                        
                        <p>Gas technicians/fitters must often fabricate brackets, stands, supports, and hangers while installing equipment. They use power grinders to do this.</p>

                        <p>A power grinder helps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>make cutting edges on cutting tools;</li>
                            <li>cut metal to its desired shape and size; and</li>
                            <li>make smooth, polished surfaces.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Power grinders may be stationary or portable.</p>

                        <h3>Angle grinders</h3>
                        <p>The angle grinder is the most widely used grinder in the piping trades. It cleans and smooths metal surfaces. Angle grinders most often grinds bevels onto the end of pipes or cleans weld spatter off pipe and fittings.</p>
