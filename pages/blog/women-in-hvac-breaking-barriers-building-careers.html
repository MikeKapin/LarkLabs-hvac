            </div>

            <p>The HVAC industry is experiencing a transformation, and women are increasingly at the forefront of this change. While traditionally male-dominated, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning sector is discovering what forward-thinking companies like LARK Labs have long recognized: diversity drives innovation, improves workplace culture, and delivers better outcomes for customers. As the industry faces a skilled labour shortage and evolving technological demands, women entering HVAC careers are finding unprecedented opportunities for growth, leadership, and entrepreneurship.</p>

            <h2>The Current Landscape</h2>

            <p>Women currently represent approximately 3-4% of HVAC technicians in Canada and the United States, though this number is steadily growing. Behind these statistics are stories of determination, skill, and success that are reshaping perceptions of who belongs in the mechanical trades. From service technicians and installers to engineers, sales professionals, and business owners, women are making their mark across every aspect of the HVAC industry.</p>

            <p>The shift isn't just about numbers—it's about recognizing that technical aptitude, problem-solving skills, and customer service excellence know no gender boundaries. Companies like LARK Labs actively champion this perspective, creating inclusive environments where talent and dedication matter more than outdated stereotypes. Their commitment to supporting women in HVAC extends beyond hiring practices to mentorship, professional development, and creating workplace cultures where everyone can thrive.</p>

            <h2>Why HVAC Offers Exceptional Opportunities for Women</h2>

            <p>The HVAC industry presents unique advantages for women seeking stable, well-paying careers without traditional four-year degree requirements. Entry-level positions often start at competitive wages, with experienced technicians earning salaries that rival or exceed many careers requiring university degrees. The constant evolution of HVAC technology—from smart home integration to renewable energy systems—means continuous learning and advancement opportunities.</p>
