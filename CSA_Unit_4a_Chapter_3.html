                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>A number of regulations fall under the <em>Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000</em>. Gas technicians need to be familiar with the regulations that directly relate to their activities, including the:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation, 215/01</em></li>
                            <li><em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation, 212/01</em>; and</li>
                            <li><em>Propane Storage and Handling Regulation, 211/01</em></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Objectives</h3>

                        <h2>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation 215/01</h2>
                        
                        <p>The fuel industry certificate is proof of having achieved a recognized level of skills and knowledge that permits the holder to carry out certain tasks it authorizes.</p>

                        <p>People, especially customers and the courts, view a certificate as a proof of "expertise". Although the raising standards for achieving certification continues, a certificate is actually not a proof of expertise but rather a proof of having met a minimum standard of qualification to conduct certain work. The <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em> specifies the certification requirements to work on hydrocarbon-fueled appliances and equipment.</p>

                        <p>It is important to understand the rights, duties, and responsibilities that come with a certificate, as well as the allowable scope of work for the certificate holder and those of his or her co-workers or employees.</p>

                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        
                        <p>The beginning of the regulation defines some important words to clarify their intent and application for all documents to which this regulation applies. A definition in the <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em> applies to the other regulations and the codes that this text will discuss later, unless those documents use the word with a new definition.</p>

                        <p>Continually refer to the definition section when reading and interpreting any regulation.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Direct supervision"</strong> means the supervision by a supervising certificate holder who is on site in close proximity to a trainee and is available to assist and supervise the trainee.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"General supervision"</strong> means the supervision by a supervising certificate holder who may or may not be on site but who is readily available to assist a trainee.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Supervising certificate holder"</strong> means a person who holds a certificate under this Regulation and provides supervision to a trainee.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The use of the word "supervision" has always been to regulate and control the type of work that an entry-level or lower-level certificate holder can do to gain work experience.</p>

                        <p>The new certification regulation recognizes that trainees—whether entry-level technicians or those seeking higher level certification—must have a means of learning the skills and knowledge of the higher level certificate categories while at the same time being of value to themselves and the company they work for while they are learning.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>Important Safety Concern</h4>
                            <p>An important safety concern is that on-the-job training experience means allowing a person to conduct work that he or she is not fully qualified for.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The clauses that use the above definitions of supervision address that safety concern while allowing on-the-job training and increasing the value of trainees to employers.</p>

                        <p>Reference to the specific clause is necessary for interpreting what type of supervision is necessary and when. However, the underlying principles are as follows:</p>

                        <p>General supervision by a supervising certificate holder may be allowed for tasks that require only a minimum skill/knowledge level and pose only a minimal safety risk to the worker and the public.</p>

                        <p>Direct supervision by a supervising certificate holder may be allowed for tasks that are inherently more difficult and have a higher potential for problems. Close supervision is required in these cases.</p>

                        <p>The Act and the Regulations confer significant duties and responsibilities on both the supervisor and employer of trainees.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Record of training"</strong> means a record issued by an approved training provider that indicates training received by a person.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>A record of training or ROT is different from a certificate. Where a specific task requires only a short training course (usually one to three days), the certification regulation may allow either a person holding a certificate or an ROT to complete the work.</p>

                        <p>ROTs apply mostly to propane transfers, cylinder inspection, and work on construction heaters or roofing equipment. Maintaining an ROT may require re-training at regular intervals.</p>

                        <p>A record of training card must be available to an inspector to prove compliance with an ROT requirement. The accredited training provider, not TSSA, is responsible for issuing the card.</p>

A portion of this clause reproduced below shows the main certificate types related to gas technicians.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>3. (1)</strong> No person shall perform the functions of a certificate holder without first having obtained a certificate from the director designating the person as one or more of the following:</p>
                            <p>1. A gas technician 1 ("G.1 certificate")</p>
                            <p>2. A gas technician 2 ("G.2 certificate")</p>
                            <p>3. A gas technician 3 ("G.3 certificate")</p>
                            <p>4. A gas piping fitter ("GP certificate")</p>

                            <p>8. A domestic appliance technician ("DA certificate")</p>
                            <p>9. A recreational vehicles technician 1 ("RV.1 certificate")</p>
                            <p>10. A recreational vehicles technician 2 ("RV.2 certificate")</p>
                            <p>11. An industrial maintenance technician ("IMT certificate")</p>
                            <p>12. A refuelling station installer – natural gas ("RSI-NG certificate")</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The abbreviation of the certificate type appears on the wallet card of those who hold the certificate. A person who holds one or more of the listed certificates receives one certificate (for the same fee) and has the designation MECH preceding the abbreviations for those certificates. MECH stands for Multi-Endorsement Certificate Holder.</p>

                            <p>Holders renew their certificates every two years on their birthday at a minimal cost. The certificate holder receives a renewal form at his/her last known address approximately 60 days before the expiry date.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>It is the certificate holder's responsibility to ensure renewal of the certificate prior to the expiry date. A key component of this responsibility is to notify TSSA about changes of address.</p>

                        <h2>Qualifications and prerequisites</h2>
                        
                        <p>The gas technician should read and become familiar with the basic qualifications necessary to hold a specific certificate as given in Clauses 5 through 16 of the <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em>.</p>

                        <p>Note that in most cases where the certificate category consists of different levels (e.g., Gas Technician 1, 2, and 3), the lower level certificate is required as a prerequisite.</p>

                        <p>To qualify for a certificate, an applicant must complete a training program with a series of examinations that are approved by the director and delivered by a training organization accredited for the purpose and registered with TSSA. See Clauses 5.(1) and (3).</p>

                        <p>The director may give exemption from the requirement to complete a training program. See Clause 5.(2).</p>

                        <p>If a person fails the exam for a certificate, he/she cannot re-take the exam until he/she submits a new application and fee and 30 days have passed (see Clause 5. (4)). Three consecutive examination failures will require the applicant to seek further training.</p>

                        <h2>Scope of certificates</h2>
                        
                        <p>Clauses 20 to 52 of the <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em> specifies the type of work that each certificate category permits is specified as the scope of certificate.</p>

                        <p>Only a holder of a certificate can conduct any tasks that fall within the specified scope of that certificate, unless the regulation states that another certificate category can conduct the work under the direct or general supervision of the applicable certificate holder.</p>

                        <p>The general lay-out of the "scope of certificates" section is to provide detailed information on the tasks allowed for the highest certificate in a category (e.g., G.1 among the gas technician categories) and then reference which aspects of the higher certificate can be completed under the lower certificate.</p>

                        <h3>G.1 scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>Gas Technician 1 certification is the highest level certificate in the gas industry. The work permitted for the holders of this valuable certificate includes that permitted of the following certificate types: G.2, G.3, DA, GP, IMT, RV.1/.2, CDT, RE-O, and the construction heater group of certificates, except as they relate to fuel oil appliances.</p>

                        <p>However, G.1 certificate holders require further training and certification to conduct the work of the following certificates to which the regulation applies: LP, ICE, GPI, RSI/T-NG, PPO-1/-2/-3, PCI-1, PTO-1, and any of the certificates dealing with fuel oil equipment.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>20. (1)</strong> A person who is the holder of a G.1 certificate may install, inspect, alter, purge, activate, repair, service or remove a natural gas or propane appliance of any BTU input and the equipment and accessories essential to its operation.</p>
                            <p><strong>(2)</strong> A person who is certified to carry out the functions described in subsection(1), may also do the following:</p>
                            <p>1. Install, inspect, test, alter, purge, activate, repair, service or remove any piping or tubing, or component in a piping or tubing system, to an appliance downstream of the natural gas meter or propane vapour service valve.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>G.2 scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>The G.1 scope of certificate forms the base for lower-level certificates that simply reference the G.1 scope. As such, G.2, G.3, DA, GP, and IMT certificate holders must refer to the G.1 scope to understand what they are permitted to do.</p>

                        <p>For example, the scope of a G.2 certificate is essentially the same as a G.1 certificate but is limited to work on appliances with inputs of 400,000 Btuh or less. The applicable section is quoted below since this is the most common certificate.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>21. (1)</strong> A person who is the holder of a G.2 certificate may install, inspect, alter, purge, activate, repair, service or remove a natural gas or propane appliance that has an input of 400,000 Btuh or less and the equipment and accessories essential to its operation.</p>
                            <p><strong>(2)</strong> When performing a function described in subsection (1), the person may do the following:</p>
                            <p>1. Perform the functions described in paragraphs 1 to 10 of subsection 20.(2) that the holder of a G.1 certificate may perform.</p>
                            <p>2. Under the direct supervision of a person who is the holder of a G.1 certificate, perform all of the functions that fall within the scope of the supervising certificate holder's certificate.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>G.3 scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>The details of the scope of the G.3 certificate are important not only to the gas technician but also to their employees, supervisors, and coworkers.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>22. (1)</strong> A person who is the holder of a G.3 certificate may, under the general supervision of a person who is the holder of a G.1, G.2 or DA certificate, carry out the following functions on a propane or natural gas appliance that falls within the scope of the supervising certificate holder's certificate, but only if the person has demonstrated the essential skills required to perform such work and has had that experience documented and signed-off by the supervising certificate holder in a form as set out and published by the director:</p>
                            <p>1. Install, test, activate or purge gas piping or tubing that is less than two and one-half inches in diameter or a component in a piping or tubing system to an appliance downstream of a natural gas meter or propane service valve up to an appliance control valve, including the completion of a pressure test tag.</p>
                            <p>2. Reactivate a previously installed or converted appliance.</p>
                            <p>3. Clean and lubricate an appliance.</p>
                            <p>4. Clean, remove or replace a vent connector, venting or a draft control device.</p>

                            <p>The G.3 certificate is primarily intended for entry-level workers. A G.3 can only conduct work under supervision. The type of supervision (direct or general) and the type of supervising certificate holder depends on the type of work as identified in Clause 22.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Three critical points require emphasis:</p>

                            <li>Only G.1, G.2, or DA certificate holders can determine whether a G.3 certificate holder has demonstrated the essential skills and acquired the work experience to allow work under the lowest level of supervision — general supervision.</li>
                            <li>General supervision of a G.3 certificate holder is only permitted for the tasks identified in Items 1 through 4 of Clause 22.(1) and only by G.1, G.2, or DA certificate holders.</li>
                            <li>A G.1, G.2, DA, GP, or IMT allows direct supervision of a G.3 certificate holder. The purpose of supervision is to allow monitoring of a trainee so that tackling or correction of any problems before they become a safety hazard is possible.</li>

                        <h3>GP scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>The Gas Piping Fitter certificate falls between the G.3 and G.2 certificates in breadth of scope. It is a certificate for those involved only in the installation of pipe and tubing systems (not appliances).</p>

                        <p>Although the appliance input does not limit the GP certificate, the holder cannot activate an appliance for the first time or perform any service, maintenance, or repair on appliances. Read Clauses 29. (1), (2), and (3) of the Regulation to learn the specific activities that a GP Certificate holder is permitted to perform.</p>

                        <p>Regarding the GP's ability to supervise a G.3 certificate holder, note that there is no specific allowance for a GP to provide general supervision of a G.3 certificate holder. Therefore, a GP is only permitted to provide direct supervision of a G.3 certificate holder.</p>

                        <h3>DA scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>The Domestic Appliance certificate also falls between the G.3 and G.2 certificates. Read Clauses 31.(1), (2), and (3) of the Regulation to learn the specific activities that a DA certificate holder is permitted to perform.</p>

                        <p>Although a DA can activate, service, and install natural gas and vapour propane appliances, the important limitations are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the maximum input of a single appliance is 100,000 Btuh;</li>
                            <li>the appliances must be unvented or a vented refrigerator; and</li>
                            <li>construction heaters are excluded from the scope.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Note that a DA certificate holder is only permitted to supervise a G.3 in relation to work that is within the above scope.</p>

                        <h3>IMT scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>The scope of the Industrial Maintenance Technician (IMT) certificate is primarily limited to work that a worker can do on specific equipment. Read Clauses 30. (1), (2), and (3) of the Regulation to learn the specific activities that an IMT certificate holder is permitted to perform.</p>

                        <p>This certificate is pertinent and available to workers and employers who have defined needs that the regular Gas Technician certificates cannot meet.</p>

                        <p>The IMT certificate often better serves the specific needs and abilities of the industrial and institutional workers, as well as appliance manufacturers' employees who work on the owner's appliance outside of the manufacturing facility.</p>

                        <p>Regarding an IMT's ability to supervise a G.3, note that there is no specific allowance for an IMT to provide general supervision of a G.3 certificate holder. Therefore, an IMT certificate holder may only provide direct supervision of a G.3.</p>

                        <h3>LP scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>A G.1, G.2, GP, or IMT may hold a Liquid Propane certificate only as an endorsement to the existing certification.</p>

                        <p>This prerequisite ensures that persons authorized to work on liquid propane systems already have strong skills and knowledge that apply to vapour piping and appliance installations. Read Clauses 26. (1) and (2) of the Regulation to learn the specific activities that a LP Certificate holder is permitted to perform.</p>

                        <h3>GUT-1 and GUT-2 scope</h3>
                        
                        <p>This scope is specifically appropriate for a gas distribution company, as it serves a distributor's customer base for inspections and meter turn-ons. The Gas Utility Technician certificate holder must be an employee of a gas utility, and the certificate is effective only during those hours of employment serving the distributor's customers. The GUT-1 certificate holder may inspect, test, adjust, purge, or activate natural gas or propane appliances as a gas company employee, but is not allowed to service or install equipment. The GUT-2 certification is limited to equipment under 400,000 Btuh input.</p>

                        <h3>Other certificates</h3>
                        
                        <p>The scopes of certificate discussed above (G.1, G.2, G.3, GP, DA, IMT, LP, and GUT) are the most common. However, there are also some less common certificates applicable to the natural gas and propane industry that are worth noting. Table 3-1 lists these certificates and the corresponding references in the Regulation.</p>

                        <h2>Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01</h2>
                        
                        <p>As we continue down the pyramid of laws governing the gas industry, the legal requirements become more specific and easier to relate to day-to-day activities.</p>

                        <p>The <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em> specifies important duties and responsibilities for all parties involved in activities related to appliances, equipment, components, and accessories where gaseous fuels are used for fuel purposes.</p>

                        <p>Since this regulation speaks directly to the gas technician's duties and responsibilities related to gas-fired appliances, keep the principle of due diligence in mind while reading, interpreting, and applying its requirements.</p>

                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        
                        <p>Important definitions are given at the beginning of a legal document to clarify the intent and application of terms used in the document. A definition in the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em> applies to the other regulations and the Codes that will appear later in this Unit unless the documents use the word with a new definition.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Appliance"</strong> means a device that consumes or is intended to consume a gas and includes all valves, fittings, controls, and components attached or to be attached to it.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>This is an important definition to remember when considering the responsibilities concerning leaving an appliance in a safe working order. Proper interpretation requires reference to the definition of "gas" in this regulation and "equipment", "accessory", and "component" in CSA B149.1.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Approved"</strong> means,</p>
                            <p>(a) with respect to a standard or a laboratory test report, that it is listed in "Titles of Standards and Laboratory Test Reports Authorized in the Province of Ontario under the Ontario Gas Utilization Code" as published by the designated administrative authority from time to time,</p>
                            <p>(b) with respect to an appliance, equipment, a component or an accessory, that it bears the label or symbol of a designated testing organization or a label or symbol authorized by the director certifying that it complies with an approved standard or a laboratory test report, or</p>
                            <p>(c) with respect to an installation or work, that it complies with this Regulation.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Regulation and codes use the word <strong>approved</strong> to qualify important requirements, such as restricting the use of appliances or designating duties and responsibilities. The definition has not changed substantially for decades. You must clearly understand it to interpret regulations and codes.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Code adoption document"</strong> means the "Gaseous Fuels Code Adoption Document" adopted as part of this Regulation under Ontario Regulation 223/01.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The code adoption documents allow for greater flexibility in adopting new codes and responding to technological changes. The Gaseous Fuels Code Adoption Document as amended by the Director's Order of Amendment (April 10, 2017) adopted and amended CSA B149.1, <em>Natural gas and propane installation code</em>. The pink pages of the Ontario edition of CSA B149.1-15 contain this document.</p>

                        <h3>Key Definitions Continued</h3>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Contractor"</strong> means a person who carries on, in whole or in part, the business of installing, removing, repairing, altering, or servicing appliances, and includes a person or an agent of the person who agrees to install, remove, repair, alter or service appliances sold or leased by the person.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>This regulation places significant duties and responsibilities on contractors, so it is important to decide if activities fall within the definition of a <em>contractor</em>.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Distributor"</strong> means a person who supplies gas to an end user, and "distribute" and "distribution" have corresponding meanings.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The deregulation of the natural gas industry has created some confusion about who is a distributor. The above definition clearly refers to the supplier—the company that owns and controls the pipeline supply system in the case of natural gas. The company that sells the gas through the natural gas pipeline is not the distributor. For propane installations, the distributor owns and controls the propane supply system.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Gas"</strong> means a gas as defined in the code adoption document.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The code adoption document actually accepts the definition of "gas" given in CSA B149.1, which states the following:</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>1.3</strong> Where the term "gas" is used, the requirements of this Code apply equally to, any of the following gases or mixtures of them: natural gas, manufactured gas, or mixtures of propane gas and air, propane, propylene, butanes (normal butane and isobutane), and butylenes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Install"</strong> includes placing an appliance in position for permanent or temporary use, venting it and connecting piping to it, and "installation" has a corresponding meaning.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Together with the definition of "installer" that the Code uses, consider this wide-ranging definition when interpreting the duties and responsibilities surrounding installation requirements.</p>

                content: `
                    <div class="section">
                        <h2>Application</h2>
                        
                        <p>It is obviously important to determine whether the regulation applies to the type of installation or activity that you are working on. Read Clause 2. of this Regulation, which identifies what it does and does not apply to.</p>

                        <p>Installations that are exempt from this regulation are subject to requirements established in other legal documents. For example, appliance and piping installations on boats are subject to the federal <em>Canada Shipping Act</em>.</p>

                        <h2>Prohibited activities without approval</h2>
                        
                        <p>The Regulation prohibits activities conducted without approval. Read Clauses 4. (1) and (2).</p>

                        <p>The regulation takes a practical and reasonable approach by allowing the usually prohibited activity if the appliance, equipment, or thing has received approval prior to use. As such, the unapproved appliance could undergo activation and testing before use for its intended purpose.</p>

                        <h2>Certificates required for various activities</h2>
                        
                        <p>The requirement to receive certification in accordance with the <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em> is endorsed in this Regulation (see 6. (1), (2), and (3)). Both regulations provide a limited exemption for duct cleaning as long as "the person does not interfere with the appliance, equipment, or thing".</p>

                        <p>Interpreting or using the exemption allowed in 6.(3) requires the application of due diligence. The exemption to proper certification for the task only applies to lower level certificate holders (e.g., G.3) working in the presence of the holder of the proper certificate.</p>

                        <p>An uncertified helper must never conduct any of the activities listed in 6. (1). However, a certificate holder who lacks authorization to repair or service an appliance (such as a G.3 or GP) can conduct this work if an appropriate certificate holder (e.g., G.1, G.2, DA, IMT, LP) is immediately present and in full control of the activity that falls within the scope of the supervising certificate holder.</p>

                        <p>The <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em> is referenced in the definition of "certificate" in the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em>. As such, the two documents support each other, and you must read them jointly when interpreting certification requirements.</p>

                        <p>For example, the <em>Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation</em> exemption for duct cleaning allows cleaning of the fans, which you should not consider separately from the exemption given in this regulation.</p>

                        <h2>Initial putting into use</h2>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>7. (1)</strong> Where premises are connected to a supply of gas for the first time, no person shall put an appliance in the premises into use for the first time until the distributor has examined the installation of the appliance and is satisfied that the installation and use of the appliance are in compliance with this Regulation.</p>
                            <p><strong>(2)</strong> An examination under subsection (1) shall include an examination of all appliances intended to be installed at the time of occupation of the premises.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Initial activation of an installation supplied for the first time carries with it specific duties, responsibilities, and liabilities.</p>

                        <p>Part 2 of the clause places a new condition on the distributor to ensure the examination of all the appliances intended for use. This prevents acceptance of an installation on the basis of examining a construction heater rather than the final installation and all appliances.</p>

                        <p>The above clause not only places significant duties and responsibilities on the distributor, but also prohibits a person who is not a representative of the distributor from initially activating an installation for the first time until the distributor has inspected and accepted the installation.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">

                        <h2>Duty of an employer</h2>
                        
                        <p>Employers are given significant duties and responsibilities to inform and monitor their employees concerning compliance with the Act and this regulation. See Clauses 11. (1) and (2).</p>

                        <p>Due diligence suggests that the notification should be in writing rather than verbal and be based on proof that the employee understands what it means to comply with the Act and this regulation. Certification or training would constitute proof in this regard.</p>

                        <p>The phrase "every precaution reasonable in the circumstances" obviously speaks to the issue of due diligence. The actions that the employer takes to ensure employee compliance must include a procedure and recordkeeping process for reasonable monitoring of the employees' actions.</p>

                        <h2>Accident or occurrence reporting and investigation</h2>
                        
                        <p>Read Clauses 12. (1), (2), and (3), which detail a certificate holder's responsibilities in reporting an incident or accident and the responsibilities associated with not disturbing the scene.</p>

                        <p>The requirement to notify an inspector in the event of an accident or occurrence suspected to result from the use, storage, or handling of gas applies to certificate holders, ROT holders, and contractors, as well as the distributor.</p>

                        <p>The Act requires the director to "order such investigation as he or she considers necessary on being notified of an accident or incident" (see Clause 25 of the Act).</p>

                        <p>Accident investigation allows for the identification of safety problems, as well as the effective enforcement of the Act and regulations.</p>

                        <p>Non-investigation of an incident due to lack of notification or unnecessary disturbance of the evidence is a lost opportunity to improve safety in the gas industry.

                            <p><strong>13.(1)</strong> In this section and in section 14, <strong>"Unacceptable condition"</strong> means</p>
                            <p>(a) with respect to an appliance, container or work, that it is being used for a purpose other than that for which it was approved;</p>
                            <p>(b) with respect to an appliance, container or work, that any alteration to it or any deterioration of it, is likely to impair its safe operation; or</p>
                            <p>(c) with respect to an appliance or work, that the condition of piping, tubing or hoses, the venting of products of combustion, the supply of air for combustion or the clearance from adjacent combustible matter is likely to impair its safe operation or that the appliance or work does not meet the requirements of this Regulation or, where it was installed before this Regulation came into force, that it does not meet the requirements of the predecessor to this Regulation as it existed when the appliance or work was installed.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>This regulation directs the actions a Gas Technician certificate holder must take to make a situation safer. The public relies on the expertise of a knowledgeable certificate holder to make decisions and perform work that is in the best interest of public safety.</p>

                        <p>These rights and responsibilities are listed to guide and support a gas technician's work in the field and provide the legal basis for taking action to correct a risky situation that may cause harm to occupants, the public, or oneself.</p>

                        <p>Distributors and certificate holders often become aware of an appliance or installation that does not comply with the regulations for various reasons (lack of maintenance, physical damage, improper installation, etc.).</p>

                        <p>Examples of "immediate hazards" might be an ineffective venting system, a cracked heat exchanger, or a supply line leak, to name just a few.</p>

                        <p>The regulations have always given specific direction to distributors, certificate holders, and owners on when and how to act in cases of unsafe appliances and installations.</p>

                        <p>The direction given in Clauses 13 and 14 of this regulation confirms and extends the duties and responsibilities of all parties.</p>

                        <p>Interpretation of these clauses depends on a clear understanding of the term "unacceptable condition", along with a reasoned judgment of what constitutes an immediate hazard.</p>

                        <h3>Distributor Actions for Immediate Hazards</h3>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>13. (2)</strong> where a distributor finds that an appliance or work is in an unacceptable condition and that it constitutes an immediate hazard, the distributor shall</p>
                            <p>(a) immediately shut off the supply of gas to the appliance or work;</p>
                            <p>(b) promptly notify the user in writing of the unacceptable condition, including a direction that the appliance or work not be used until the condition is corrected; and</p>
                            <p>(c) affix a notice containing the information referred to in clause (d) to the appliance or work.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Distributors have significantly more power to control the supply of gas to an appliance or work compared to contractors or certificate holders.</p>

                        <p>Although certificate holders have similar duties and responsibilities, they must enlist the help of the distributor who has ultimate control over the gas supply.</p>

                        <p>These actions will help ensure the shutoff of fuel supplies and the awareness of all parties of the situation that you have uncovered, made safe, and will keep safe until such time as it is corrected.</p>

                            <p>(a) immediately shut off the supply of gas to the appliance or work;</p>
                            <p>(b) promptly give oral notice of the shutting off of the gas to the distributor;</p>
                            <p>(c) promptly give a written notice to the user,</p>

                            <p>(d) within 14 days of finding the condition, give written notice of the condition to the distributor, including notice that the supply of gas has been shut off; and</p>
                            <p>(e) affix a notice containing the information required in clause (c) to the appliance or work.</p>

                            <p>The means of satisfying Item (e) include:</p>

                            <p>A "DO NOT USE" tag should contain clear information about the hazardous condition, who identified it, and contact information. The tag serves as an immediate visual warning to prevent use of dangerous equipment.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Owners and users of the appliance or work share in the duties, responsibilities, and liabilities associated with the actions of a distributor or certificate holder. (See 13. (4) and (5).)</p>

                        <p>The notice affixed to the appliance or work entails certain restrictions and conditions for removal:</p>

                        <h3>Notice Removal Requirements</h3>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>13. (6)</strong> Where a notice is affixed to an appliance or work under clause (2) (c) or (3) (e), no person shall remove the notice unless the person holds a certificate for that purpose and on removing the notice the person shall endorse his or her certificate number, name and address on the notice and send it by prepaid registered mail or deliver it to the distributor.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Where a distributor or certificate holder finds an appliance or work in an unacceptable condition and it does not constitute an immediate hazard, shutoff of the gas does not have to be immediate.</p>

                        <p>Providing the owner with immediate written notice describing the condition and advising him/her of the sending of a notice to the distributor is still a requirement for the certificate holder. He/she must also give the same written notice to the distributor within 14 days and affix a notice to the appliance or work.</p>

                        <p>It is the responsibility of the certificate holder who finds the unacceptable condition to set the time period for correcting the unacceptable condition. The time period should be reasonable and cannot exceed 90 days. The certificate holder must include the required completion date in the notices that he/she provided the owner and the distributor with.</p>

                        <p>The owner and user are responsible for responding to the notice of an unacceptable condition. Only a certificate holder can remove the notice (affixed to the appliance or equipment). The notice of correction must be sent to the distributor.</p>

                        <p>The distributor's duties and responsibilities do not end with the initial examination required under Clause 7 nor with the action required upon identifying an unacceptable condition. They are ongoing.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>16.</strong> No distributor shall supply gas to a premise unless the distributor is satisfied that the installation and use of the appliance or work comply with this Regulation and,</p>
                            <p>(a) unless the distributor has inspected the appliance or work at least once within the previous 10 years; or</p>

                        <p>Reference to a quality assurance inspection program in Part (b) of the clause consists of a set of policies and procedures for auditing and responding to existing installation concerns. It must meet the approval of the director and is subject to audit by TSSA.</p>

                            <p><strong>15.</strong> An owner or user of an appliance, equipment, a work or any other thing employed in the handling or use of gas shall ensure that the appliance, equipment, work or thing employed in the handling or use of gas is maintained in a safe operating condition.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Certificate holders may wish to advise their customers of their legal responsibilities by referencing the above clause.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <h4>Maintenance Responsibility</h4>
                            <p>Failure to maintain appliances in a safe operating condition is the single largest cause of accidents. Past regulations recognize the owner's and user's responsibilities to maintain the equipment.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>TSSA has issued a safety directive over the past four heating seasons requiring gas technicians to ensure annual maintenance of domestic heating boilers and that carbon monoxide levels in the vent are below 100 ppm (otherwise, they must shut the boiler down). This reflects TSSA safety data collection indicating the importance of annual maintenance, which is ultimately the responsibility of the appliance owner.</p>

                        <h2>Approval of appliances</h2>
                        
                        <p>For an appliance, equipment, component, or accessory to gain approval for sale, lease, rent, or installation in Ontario, its construction must be according to the applicable recognized standard, and it must undergo testing by and receive labelling from a designated certification organization.</p>

                        <p>The approval process may happen:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Off-site</strong> from where you will install the appliance, equipment, etc. (typically this is a certification process); or</li>
                            <li><strong>On-site</strong> (typically through field approval by TSSA)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The former is the most common with mass-produced appliances, equipment, etc., certified off-site in a testing laboratory, while on-site testing and approval usually works for one-of-a-kind or larger appliances.</p>

                        <p>Clause 18 of the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em> outlines the requirements for off-site testing and approval, while Clause 19 deals with on-site testing and approval.</p>

                        <p>Gas technicians should look for a certification marking on an appliance rating plate, valve body, hose, manufacturer's instruction, etc., to ensure that the item is <strong>approved</strong>.</p>

                        <p>They would then check the marking against the list of certification organizations provided in the natural gas or propane regulations to determine if it receives designation for the purpose in Ontario.</p>

                        <p>The regulation does not list the designated testing organizations. Rather it states the following:</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>18. (3)</strong> The organizations accredited by the Standards Council of Canada are designated as organizations to test appliances, equipment, components and accessories to the applicable approved standards or laboratory test reports for the purposes of this Regulation.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Certification organizations</h2>
                        
                        <p>There are dozens of testing organizations, but the Standards Council of Canada designated only five certification organizations to certify gas appliances, equipment, components, and accessories. Below are the organizations, along with their corresponding certification marks:</p>

                        <div class="info-box">

                            <p>The five designated certification organizations for gas equipment in Canada are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>CSA Group</strong> - Various certification marks including CSA symbols</li>
                                <li><strong>Intertek Testing Services</strong> - ETL and related marks</li>
                                <li><strong>OMNI Test Laboratories Inc.</strong> - OMNI marks</li>
                                <li><strong>Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada</strong> - ULC marks</li>
                                <li><strong>Underwriters Laboratories Inc.</strong> - UL marks with 'C' designation for Canada</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>Note that the ETL, Warnock Hersey, OTL, and UL Marks must have a letter "c" beside the label to designate that the gas equipment has received certification for Canada. If the Warnock Hersey mark lacks a "c" and a "US", it has gained certification for Canada.</p>

                        <p>On-site testing of appliances, equipment, components, or accessories is more common in industrial installations. Certificate holders involved with industrial, custom, one-of-a-kind, or foreign appliances will want to review Clause 19 of the regulation.</p>

                            <p>TSSA conducts the testing and approval for these types of appliances, equipment, components, and accessories. If its fuel features comply with the approved standard or laboratory test report or CSA B149.3-15 and this regulation, an inspector applies a TSSA field label. This approval is site-specific, so transfer of the appliance to another site requires re-approval.</p>

                        <p>Most Acts or regulations employ registration of activities and equipment as a means of cataloguing and controlling the activity or equipment. For example, registering under the Business Services Act is a requirement for businesses and registering under the Highway Traffic Act for vehicles.</p>

                        <p>The purpose in all cases is the same. Registration allows the authority having jurisdiction to know who has control and responsibility over the activity or equipment for notification purposes. Registration requirements also give the authority control over the activity or equipment in that it can refuse or revoke registration if a person does not meet the requirements.</p>

                        <p>Contractor registration allows TSSA to track compliance and contact those in the business of installing, removing, repairing, altering, or servicing appliances. It is also a means for customers of such businesses to determine whether the company is working in compliance with safety requirements.</p>

                        <p>Contractor registration is a type of "authorization" as identified in the Act. It carries with it specific duties, responsibilities, and rights separate from certification, licenses, or other forms of registration.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p>Clause 21 deals with contractor registrations and should be read in entirety.</p>

                        <p>The requirement to clearly display the registration number on field vehicles will ensure higher compliance with the registration requirement, as well as customer recognition of your commitment to industry requirements.</p>

                            <p>Field vehicles must clearly display the contractor registration number, which helps ensure compliance and provides customer confidence in the contractor's commitment to regulatory requirements.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>It is worth noting that separate registration numbers are a requirement for "subcontractors".</p>

                        <h2>Propane Storage and Handling Regulation 211/01</h2>
                        
                        <p>The <em>Propane Storage and Handling Regulation</em> is very similar to the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em> but applies to fewer technicians. It specifies important duties and responsibilities for technicians, contractors, distributors, owners, and users involved in the following activities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the storage, handling, transportation, and transfer of propane;</li>
                            <li>the installation of appliances, equipment, components, accessories, and containers on highway vehicles, recreational vehicles, mobile housing, outdoor food service Units, and wash-mobiles when technicians use propane for fuel purposes; and</li>
                            <li>the installation of containers and equipment that technicians will use for propane in distribution locations and filling plants and on tank trucks, tank trailers, and cargo liners.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        
                        <p>As noted in previous Sections, important definitions are given at the beginning of a legal document to clarify their intent and application for all documents. A definition in the <em>Propane Storage and Handling Regulation</em> applies to other regulations and codes unless those documents use the word with a new definition.</p>

                        <p>Continually refer to the definition section when reading and interpreting any regulation.</p>

                        <p>Many definitions are similar to those covered within <strong>Definitions</strong> in the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01</em> section and are not reproduced here. These include "appliance", "approved", and "contractor".</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Code adoption document"</strong> means the "Propane Code Adoption Document" adopted as part of this Regulation under Ontario Regulation 223/01.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The code adoption documents allow for greater flexibility in adopting new codes and responding to technological changes.</p>

                        <p>The Propane Code Adoption Document as amended by the Director's Order of Amendment, July 1, 2017, adopted and amended CSA B149.2, <em>Propane Storage and Handling Code</em>. This Document is found in the salmon-coloured pages of the Ontario edition of CSA B149.2-15.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Distributor"</strong> means a person who conveys or supplies propane to an end user, but does not include a person who supplies propane to a vehicle or cylinder, and "distribute" and "distribution" have corresponding meanings.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The Act and this regulation place significant duties and responsibilities on distributors.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that this definition is different from that in the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em> (covered in Section 2). It specifically excludes persons who supply propane to vehicles or cylinders from being considered as distributors.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Equipment"</strong> means a device that is used in venting propane or in the handling of propane.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>This definition should be read in conjunction with the definition of "handling" for full appreciation of its meaning when used in this regulation.</p>

                        <div class="regulation-box">
                            <p><strong>"Propane"</strong> means propane as defined in the code adoption document.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The code adoption document actually accepts the definition of "propane" given in the CSA B149.2-15 Code, which states the following:</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>1.3</strong> Where the term "propane" is used, the requirements of this Code include, and apply equally to, any material that is composed predominantly of any of the following hydrocarbons or mixtures of them: propane, propylene, butanes (normal and isobutane), and butylenes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Application</h3>
                        
                        <p>It is obviously important to determine whether the regulation applies to the type of installation or activity that you are working on. Read Clause 2. of this regulation, which identifies what it does and does not apply to.</p>

                        <p>Installations that are exempt are subject to requirements established in other legal documents. For example, appliance installations on boats are subject to the federal <em>Canada Shipping Act</em>.</p>

                        <h2>Risk and safety management plans</h2>
                        
                        <p>Amendments to O. Reg 211/01 in 2009 now require propane filling plants and facilities to have a safety plan in effect to identify how a licensed operator would handle a hazardous event, such as a fire or explosion, in the interest of public safety.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>3.1 (1)</strong> A person who holds a license to operate a retail outlet, filling plant, cardlock/keylock, private outlet or container refill centre shall prepare a risk and safety management plan, which shall, at a minimum, address the following matters:</p>
                            <p>1. A hazard analysis that identifies possible hazardous scenarios, the frequency of those scenarios and their consequences, and that takes into account,</p>
                            <p>i. the most severe incident or situation that could occur at the referenced facility based on the total capacity of propane at the referenced facility, and</p>

                        </div>

                        <h2>Duty of an employer</h2>
                        
                        <p>Clauses 5. (1) and (2) dealing with duties of an employer are similar to Clauses 11. (1) and (2) of the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01</em> section.</p>

                        <h2>Certificates required for various activities</h2>
                        
                        <p>This regulation endorses the requirement to receive certification in accordance with the Fuel Industry Certificates Regulation. Like the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em>, this regulation provides a limited exemption for lower-level certificate holders to conduct the work within the scope of higher-level certificate holders when working <strong>in the actual presence</strong> of the appropriate level certificate holder. See Clauses 8. (1) and (2) of the Regulation.</p>

                        <h2>Initial activation</h2>
                        
                        <p>Initial activation of an installation supplied for the first time entails specific duties, responsibilities, and liabilities.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>9. (1)</strong> Where premises are connected to a supply of propane for the first time, no person shall put into use for the first time an appliance in the premises that is connected to a propane supply until the distributor has examined the installation of the appliance and is satisfied that the installation and use of the appliance are in compliance with the Act and this Regulation.</p>
                            <p><strong>(2)</strong> An examination under subsection (1) shall include the examination of all appliances to be installed at the time of occupation of the premises.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Sub clause (2) places a new condition on the distributor to ensure the examination of all the appliances intended for use. The practical application of this clause is limited since this regulation only applies to appliance installations on highway vehicles, RVs, mobile homes, outdoor food service Units, and wash-mobiles.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the definition of distributor effectively excludes these types of installations since a person supplying propane to a vehicle or cylinder is not a distributor.</p>

                        <h2>Prohibited activities without approval</h2>
                        
                        <p>Refer to Clause 12. (1) and (2) of the <em>Propane Storage and Handling Regulation</em>. Note that these clauses are similar to Clauses 4. (1) and (2) of the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01</em> section.</p>

                        <h2>Accident or occurrence reporting and investigation</h2>
                        
                        <p>Refer to Clauses 15. (1), (2), and (3) of the <em>Propane Storage and Handling Regulation</em>. Note that these clauses are similar to Clauses 12. (1), (2), and (3) of the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation 212/01</em> section.</p>

                        <h2>Duties and responsibilities of distributors, certificate holders, and owners concerning safe operation condition</h2>
                        
                        <p>This regulation has two important sections not found in the <em>Gaseous Fuels Regulation</em>.</p>

                        <p>The following clauses clearly speak about the responsibilities of all parties and, as such, deserve close review and consideration.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>16.</strong> No person shall knowingly supply propane to or use an appliance, a container, equipment, a propane vehicle, a work or other thing employed in the handling or use of propane that does not comply with this Regulation or, where it was installed before this Regulation came into force, that does not comply with the requirements of the predecessor to this Regulation as it existed when it was installed.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>17. (1)</strong> An owner and every person responsible for the operation of an appliance, a container, equipment, a work or any other thing employed in the handling or use of propane shall ensure that it is maintained in a safe operating condition.</p>
                            <p><strong>(2)</strong> No person shall operate or permit to be operated, an appliance or work unless it is maintained in a safe operating condition and it complies with this Regulation or, where it was installed before this Regulation came into force, that it complies with the requirements of the predecessor to this Regulation as it existed when it was installed.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Failure to maintain appliances in a safe operating condition is the single largest cause of accidents. Past regulations recognize the responsibility of owners and users to maintain the equipment.</p>

                        <p>Certificate holders may wish to advise their customers about their legal responsibilities by referencing Clause 17 above.</p>

                        <h2>Responsibilities of a distributor</h2>
                        
                        <p>The distributor's duties and responsibilities do not end with the initial examination required under Clause 9 nor with the action required when an unacceptable condition is identified (as discussed below). They are ongoing like the propane supply, transfer, or transportation operations.</p>

                        <div class="clause-box">
                            <p><strong>18. (1)</strong> No distributor shall supply propane to a container that is connected to an appliance or work unless the distributor is satisfied that the installation and use of the appliance or work complies with the Act and this Regulation and</p>
